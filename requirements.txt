# AWS Serverless Application Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# This requirements file contains all Python dependencies needed for the
# serverless Lambda functions in this project.
#
# Core Dependencies:
# - boto3: AWS SDK for Python (Lambda runtime includes this, but specified for local dev)
# - botocore: Low-level AWS service access (dependency of boto3)
#
# Testing Dependencies:
# - pytest: Testing framework for unit tests
# - moto: AWS service mocking for testing
# - pytest-cov: Coverage reporting for tests
#
# Development Dependencies:
# - black: Code formatting
# - flake8: Linting and style checking
# - mypy: Static type checking
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Note: Lambda runtime provides boto3 and botocore, but local development
# and testing requires explicit installation.
